**USL** is a high-performance shader transpiler written in the Mojo programming language, designed to unify various shader languages into a single cohesive language. With USL, developers can write shaders in a standardized language and deploy them seamlessly across multiple platforms and graphics engines. The primary goal is to facilitate a smooth transition from WebGL to WebGPU.

## Features

- **Unified Language**: Write shaders once and deploy them anywhere.
- **High Performance**: Supa-fast translation and execution.
- **Extensible**: Supports multiple shader types, including vertex, fragment, and geometry.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with various graphics engines and platforms.
- **Smooth Transition**: Eases the migration from WebGL to WebGPU.
- **One Shader to Rule Them All**: Consolidate all shader languages into a single, universal language.

## Sharp Edges

While USL aims to provide a seamless experience, there are some areas that may require caution:

* **Experimental Features**: Certain advanced features are still experimental and may not be fully stable.
* **Platform-Specific Bugs**: Some platform-specific issues may arise, especially during the transition from WebGL to WebGPU.
* **Performance Overheads**: While USL is optimized for speed, some complex shaders may introduce performance overheads during translation.
